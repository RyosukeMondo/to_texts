# Issues Found and How to Fix Them

## Summary
✅ **4 Major Features Working**
⚠️ **1 Feature Blocked by Missing Credentials**

---

## Issue #1: Missing Z-Library Credentials ⚠️

### Severity: Medium (Search/Download blocked)
### Status: Requires user configuration

### What's Broken
Search and download functionality cannot work without Z-Library login credentials.

**Error Message:**
```
Error: No valid credentials found in .env file
Please set either ZLIBRARY_EMAIL/ZLIBRARY_PASSWORD or
ZLIBRARY_REMIX_USERID/ZLIBRARY_REMIX_USERKEY
```

### Root Cause
The `.env` file does not exist in `packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/`

### How to Fix

#### Option 1: Use Remix Credentials (Recommended)
1. Go to https://z-lib.sk and log in
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Application** → **Cookies**
4. Find and copy:
   - `remix_userid` value
   - `remix_userkey` value
5. Create the .env file:
   ```bash
   cp packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/.env.example \
      packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/.env
   ```
6. Edit `.env` and add:
   ```env
   ZLIBRARY_REMIX_USERID=your_userid_here
   ZLIBRARY_REMIX_USERKEY=your_userkey_here
   ```
7. Test:
   ```bash
   cd packages/python/zlibrary-downloader
   ./run.sh --tui
   ```

#### Option 2: Use Email and Password
1. Create the .env file:
   ```bash
   cp packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/.env.example \
      packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/.env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and add:
   ```env
   ZLIBRARY_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   ZLIBRARY_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```
3. Test:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh --title "Python" --limit 5
   ```

### Verification
Once fixed, this command should work:
```bash
./run.sh --title "python 2025" --year-from 2025 --limit 5
```

### Verification
```bash
python3 -c "from zlibrary_downloader.client import Zlibrary; print('✓ OK')"
# Output: ✓ OK
```

## Issue #4: Rust Binary Already Built ✅

### Severity: None (Not an issue)
### Status: Complete

### What Was Checked

## Quick Fix Checklist

To get everything working:

- [ ] **For Search/Download**: Configure `.env` with Z-Library credentials (5 min)
  ```bash
  cp packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/.env.example \
     packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/.env
  # Edit with your credentials
  ```

- [ ] **Test Everything**:
  ```bash
  python3 test_download_extract.py
  ```

## Testing After Fixes

### Test 1: Verify Credentials Work
```bash
cd packages/python/zlibrary-downloader
./run.sh --title "Python" --limit 3
```
Expected: Shows 3 search results

### Test 2: Download a Book
```bash
./run.sh --title "Atomic Habits" --download
```
Expected: File appears in `downloads/` directory

### Test 3: Extract Downloaded Books
```bash
cd ../..
./packages/rust/target/release/text-extractor \
  --target packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/downloads \
  --output ./test_extract
```
Expected: Creates text files in `test_extract/`

## Prevention Going Forward

### To Avoid Issue #1
- Always add credentials before running download commands
- Store `.env` file safely (add to `.gitignore` for security)
- Use remix credentials (more stable than passwords)
