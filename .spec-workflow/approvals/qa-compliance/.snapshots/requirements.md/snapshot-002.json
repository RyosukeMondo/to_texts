The purpose is to bridge the gap between our stated QA goals (defined in product.md) and the current state of the codebase, which lacks automated enforcement mechanisms.\n\nThe QA compliance system will establish automated validation of code quality standards including type checking, linting, formatting, cyclomatic complexity limits, and file/function size constraints. This ensures maintainability, reliability, and consistency across both Rust and Python codebases.\n\n**Value to users (developers):**\n- Catch quality issues before commit (shift-left approach)\n- Consistent code style across the project\n- Reduced technical debt accumulation\n- Higher confidence in code changes\n- Enforced best practices via automation\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports multiple Product Principles defined in product.md:\n\n1. **Quality First** (Principle #7): \"Enforce rigorous code quality standards through automated tooling and pre-commit verification\"\n\n2. **Maintainability**: Supports long-term project sustainability through enforced standards\n\n3. **Developer Experience**: Provides immediate feedback on quality issues\n\nThe feature implements the Quality Assurance Standards section in product.md, specifically:\n- SOLID, SLAP, SSOT, KISS principles (enforced through complexity limits)\n- Code Metrics & Limits (400 lines/file, 30 lines/function, complexity ≤10)\n- Type Safety & Verification (compile-time type checking)\n- Pre-commit Verification (automated quality gates)\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Pre-commit Hook Infrastructure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks to automatically validate my code before commits, so that I catch quality issues immediately and prevent them from entering the repository.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer attempts to commit code THEN the system SHALL automatically run pre-commit hooks\n2. WHEN any pre-commit check fails THEN the system SHALL block the commit and display clear error messages\n3. WHEN all pre-commit checks pass THEN the system SHALL allow the commit to proceed\n4. IF pre-commit is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions\n5. WHEN hooks are configured THEN the system SHALL support both Rust and Python validation\n6. WHEN developers run `pre-commit run --all-files` THEN the system SHALL validate the entire codebase\n\n### Requirement 2: Python Type Hint Coverage\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete type hints throughout the Python codebase, so that mypy can verify type correctness and catch type-related bugs at development time.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN mypy runs on the Python codebase THEN it SHALL complete without errors\n2. WHEN a function lacks type hints THEN mypy SHALL report it as an error\n3. WHEN type hints are present THEN they SHALL follow PEP 484 and PEP 526 standards\n4. IF a function has complex types THEN it SHALL use proper type annotations (List, Dict, Optional, Union)\n5. WHEN mypy runs in strict mode THEN it SHALL pass with zero errors\n\n**Files requiring type hints:**\n- `packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/zlibrary_downloader/cli.py`\n- `packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/zlibrary_downloader/client.py`\n- `packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/zlibrary_downloader/tui.py`\n- `packages/python/zlibrary-downloader/zlibrary_downloader/__init__.py`\n\n### Requirement 3: Cyclomatic Complexity Audit and Refactoring\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want all functions to have cyclomatic complexity ≤10, so that code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN complexity analysis runs THEN it SHALL identify all functions with complexity >10\n2. WHEN a function has complexity >10 THEN it SHALL be refactored into smaller functions\n3. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all functions SHALL have complexity ≤10\n4. IF a function is refactored THEN it SHALL maintain the same behavior (verified by tests)\n5. WHEN pre-commit hooks run THEN they SHALL block commits with complexity >10\n\n**Tools:**\n- Rust: `cargo-complexity` or `rust-code-analysis`\n- Python: `radon cc` with threshold of 10\n\n### Requirement 4: Line Count Validation\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated validation of file and function size limits, so that code remains modular and doesn't become unwieldy.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a file exceeds 400 lines THEN pre-commit SHALL fail with an error\n2. WHEN a function exceeds 30 lines THEN pre-commit SHALL fail with an error\n3. IF test files or generated code exceed limits THEN they SHALL be excluded from validation\n4. WHEN size limits are violated THEN the error message SHALL specify which file/function and by how much\n5. WHEN developers check file sizes THEN the system SHALL provide a report of all files approaching the limit\n\n**Exclusions:**\n- Test files (tests/*.py, *_test.py, test_*.rs)\n- Generated code (target/, venv/, __pycache__)\n- Build artifacts\n\n### Requirement 5: Rust Quality Tooling\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated Rust quality checks, so that Rust code adheres to language best practices and conventions.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN code is committed THEN `cargo check` SHALL run and pass\n2. WHEN code is committed THEN `cargo clippy` SHALL run with no warnings\n3. WHEN code is committed THEN `rustfmt` SHALL verify formatting compliance\n4. IF clippy identifies issues THEN clear suggestions SHALL be provided\n5. WHEN clippy runs THEN it SHALL use the project's clippy configuration (if present)\n\n**Clippy Lints:**\n- Enable strict lints: `clippy::all`, `clippy::pedantic`\n- Deny: `clippy::unwrap_used`, `clippy::expect_used` in production code\n\n### Requirement 6: Python Quality Tooling\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated Python quality checks, so that Python code adheres to PEP standards and best practices.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN code is committed THEN `mypy` SHALL run and pass with zero errors\n2. WHEN code is committed THEN `flake8` SHALL run and pass with zero violations\n3. WHEN code is committed THEN `black` SHALL verify formatting (check mode)\n4. WHEN flake8 runs THEN it SHALL enforce line length of 100 characters\n5. WHEN flake8 runs THEN it SHALL enforce McCabe complexity ≤10\n\n**flake8 Configuration:**\n- Max line length: 100\n- Max complexity: 10\n- Exclude: venv/, .git/, __pycache__, *.egg-info\n\n**mypy Configuration:**\n- Strict mode enabled\n- No implicit optional\n- Warn on unused ignores\n\n### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive testing infrastructure, so that I can write and run tests easily and track coverage.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN pytest is installed THEN it SHALL be available in the Python environment\n2. WHEN developers run tests THEN pytest SHALL discover and execute all test files\n3. WHEN coverage is measured THEN it SHALL generate detailed reports\n4. IF coverage is below 80% THEN a warning SHALL be displayed (non-blocking initially)\n5.

WHEN pre-commit runs THEN it SHALL use `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in repo root\n2. WHEN mypy runs THEN it SHALL use configuration from `pyproject.toml`\n3. WHEN flake8 runs THEN it SHALL use configuration from `.flake8` or `pyproject.toml`\n4. WHEN black runs THEN it SHALL use configuration from `pyproject.toml`\n5. WHEN clippy runs THEN it SHALL use configuration from `clippy.toml` or `Cargo.toml`\n6. IF configuration is missing THEN tools SHALL use sensible defaults matching project standards\n\n**Configuration Files to Create:**\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (repo root)\n- `.flake8` or extend `pyproject.toml` (Python package)\n- `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml` for tool config (Python package)\n\n### Requirement 9: Documentation and Developer Onboarding\n\n**User Story:** As a new developer, I want clear documentation on setting up and using quality tools, so that I can quickly become productive and compliant.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer clones the repository THEN README SHALL include QA setup instructions\n2. WHEN a developer installs tools THEN instructions SHALL cover all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)\n3. WHEN pre-commit fails THEN error messages SHALL explain how to fix common issues\n4. IF a developer needs to bypass hooks THEN documentation SHALL explain when and how (emergency only)\n5.

WHEN pre-commit is first enabled THEN it SHALL warn but not block on existing violations\n2. WHEN new code is committed THEN it SHALL enforce strict compliance\n3. WHEN developers run audits THEN they SHALL receive reports on existing violations\n4. IF refactoring is in progress THEN tools SHALL support incremental fixes\n5. WHEN all violations are fixed THEN enforcement SHALL become strict (block commits)\n\n**Migration Phases:**\n1. Phase 1: Install tools, run audits, report violations (non-blocking)\n2. Phase 2: Enable blocking for new code/modified files only\n3. Phase 3: Refactor existing violations\n4. Phase 4: Enable strict blocking for all code\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each validation script has one purpose (type check, lint, format, etc.)\n- **Modular Design**: Pre-commit hooks are independent and can be enabled/disabled individually\n- **Dependency Management**: Quality tools are development dependencies, not runtime dependencies\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Each tool has clear input (code files) and output (pass/fail + messages)\n\n### Performance\n- **Pre-commit Speed**: All pre-commit hooks SHALL complete in <30 seconds for typical commits\n- **Incremental Checks**: Tools SHALL only check modified files when possible (not full codebase)\n- **Caching**: Pre-commit framework SHALL cache results to avoid redundant checks\n- **Parallel Execution**: Independent checks SHALL run in parallel when possible\n\n### Security\n- **Tool Integrity**: All quality tools SHALL be installed from trusted sources (crates.io, PyPI)\n- **Configuration Security**: Configuration files SHALL not contain secrets or credentials\n- **Sandbox Execution**: Pre-commit hooks SHALL not modify files outside the repository\n\n### Reliability\n- **Deterministic Results**: Running the same checks on the same code SHALL always produce the same result\n- **Error Handling**: Failed hooks SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages\n- **Graceful Degradation**: If a tool is missing, clear installation instructions SHALL be provided\n- **Version Pinning**: Tool versions SHALL be specified to ensure consistent behavior\n\n### Usability\n- **Clear Feedback**: Error messages SHALL specify file, line number, and how to fix\n- **Auto-fixing**: Tools with auto-fix capability (black, rustfmt) SHALL offer to fix automatically\n- **IDE Integration**: Configuration SHALL be compatible with popular IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ Rust)\n- **Manual Execution**: All checks SHALL be runnable manually outside of pre-commit\n\n### Maintainability\n- **Version Updates**: Tool versions SHALL be easy to update in one place\n- **Tool Addition**: Adding new quality checks SHALL require minimal configuration\n- **Cross-platform**: Configuration SHALL work on Linux, macOS, and Windows\n- **CI/CD Ready**: Same tools used locally SHALL be usable in CI/CD pipelines\n",
